Git should be used for all projects.

 - [Git-flow](#git-flow)
 - [Github-flow](#github-flow)
 - [Tooling](#tooling)

Git-flow is the standard branching model to be used. In some edge cases, Github-flow may be used.

## Git Flow

*Large projects with standard release frequency*

Learn about the [Git-flow][gitflow-workflow] model and how to implement it. 

> The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. While somewhat more complicated than the Feature Branch Workflow, this provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

 -- [Vincent Driessen][gitflow-workflow]

> The general idea behind git-flow is to have several separate branches that always exist, each for a different purpose: master, develop, feature, release, and hotfix.
The process of feature or bug development flows from one branch into another before itâ€™s finally released.

 -- Nicholas Zakas
