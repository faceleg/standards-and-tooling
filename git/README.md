# git

Git should be used for all projects.

 - [Commits](#commits)
 - [Commit messages](#commit-messages)
 - [Git-flow](#git-flow)
 - [Github-flow](#github-flow)
 - [Tooling](#tooling)

## Commits

 - A single commit should be thought of as a "changeset" and as such should contain only changes that are related or required in order for the changeset to be an atomic unit of work
 - Commit often and early

## Commit messages

 - Commit messages should describe the changeset that the committed files represent:
  > Implemented basic authentication for wibbles as they wobble around the flibbly wibbler

 - Where a commit is related to an artefact that exists in the real world, i.e. a JIRA ticket, the commit should be prefixed with the artefact's identifier, and the title or portion of the title, and an optional clarification:
 
  > JIRA-253 Network restrictions should only be mandatory if wobbles are flobbing around the wibbly
 - Single word or unintelligible commit messages are not acceptable for any reason

## Git Flow

*Large projects with standard release frequency*

Git-flow is the standard branching model to be used. In some edge cases, Github-flow may be used.

Learn about the [Git-flow][gitflow-workflow] model and how to implement it. View the [Git-flow cheatsheet][git-flow-cheatsheet]

> The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. While somewhat more complicated than the Feature Branch Workflow, this provides a robust framework for managing larger projects.

 -- [Vincent Driessen][gitflow-workflow]

> The general idea behind git-flow is to have several separate branches that always exist, each for a different purpose: master, develop, feature, release, and hotfix.
The process of feature or bug development flows from one branch into another before itâ€™s finally released.

 -- Nicholas Zakas

## Github Flow

*Smaller projects or those with continuous deployments*

Learn about the [Github-flow][github-flow] model and how to implement it.

> GitHub Flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly. This guide explains how and why GitHub Flow works.
